# CurbEase Valet â€” Site Update (2025-08-28)

## What I changed
- Inserted **new Pricing section** with tiers: Basic $30, Standard $45 (incl. 1 bin cleaning/mo), Premium $60 (incl. 2 bin cleanings/mo).
- Created or ensured pages exist: privacy.html, terms.html, b2b.html, thank-you.html.
- Updated Netlify **_redirects** for `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/b2b`, `/thank-you`.
- Added Privacy/Terms/B2B links to footer if a `<footer>` was found.
- Note: You can map plan buttons to Stripe links once ready.

## Next Steps
1. Upload this zip to Netlify.
2. Test the new routes.
3. Review pricing layout on mobile.
4. Map plan buttons to Stripe.
